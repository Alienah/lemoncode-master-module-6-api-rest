# lemoncode-master-module-6-REST-api

This is a simple app to apply knowledge learned in Front End Master about REST api.

We have used a boilerplate from [MÃ¡ster Front End Online Lemoncode](https://lemoncode.net/master-frontend#inicio-banner).

We have created different branches in order to practice different exercises:

- In **_master_** and **_exercise-1_** branches you will find the exercise 1: To use fetch or axios with rick and morty api rest

- In **_exercise-2_** branch, we have implemented the exercise 2: To use local json-server to replace the endpoints from the exercise 1, but including a new field (bestSentences) and to implement the edition of fields

- In **_optional_** branch, you will find the migration of the exercise-1 to graphql.

## How to use

* Move to each mentioned branch and do
* ```npm install```
* ```cd server && npm install```
* ```cd ..```
* ```npm run start```
